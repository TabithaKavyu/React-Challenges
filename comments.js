/*SX is a syntax that gets compiled into valid JavaScript. Sometimes, for readability, you might need to add comments to your code.
Like most programming languages, JSX has its own way to do this.To put comments inside JSX, you use the syntax {/* */} to wrap around the comment text*/
//Example

const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h1>This is a block of JSX</h1>
    <p>Here's a subtitle</p>
    {/*This does not change anything */}
  </div>
);
